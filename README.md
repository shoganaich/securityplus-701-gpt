### <div align="center">🚀Your AI-powered study assistant for the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam</div>  

## 📚 Overview  
Most study resources for Security+ 701 exam prep, especially those in the public GPT, have serious limitations:  
- ❌ **Outdated Information**: Many rely on content from the older **SY0-601 exam**, which can mislead learners.  
- ❌ **Unverified Knowledge**: Most exam prep GPTs pull information from web-scraped sources—not from **official course materials** or trusted study guides.  

### Why This Project?  
I created this **Custom GPT** to solve these issues and make Security+ exam prep easier and more reliable. This custom AI assistant focuses on **SY0-701 objectives** with tailored instructions and verified content to deliver **clear, accurate answers** and valuable insights into exam questions.

## 🌟 Key Features  
- **Simple yet Professional Explanations**  
  Just give it a concept (e.g., "TCP" or "Encryption"), and it will explain it in a **clear, professional style** that’s easy to understand.  
- **Exam-Focused Guidance**  
  Not only does it explain the concept, but it also tells you **how it will appear in the exam**, so you’ll know what to expect.  
- **Concept Comparison**  
  Provide two concepts (e.g., "TCP vs. UDP"), and the GPT will **compare them side by side** and explain how they relate to other topics and their importance in the exam.  
- **Question Interpretation Help**  
  Struggling to understand a practice question? The GPT will break it down for you, helping you grasp what’s being asked and how to approach the answer.
